# web-interface

This is the web-interface for the project.

The backend part of the project is a .NET Core application and the frontend is Angular.

## Development

The easiest way to develop the app to run `npm run watch`. This watches the files both in the dotnet core and the angular directories.

The other way to develop is run the code from VS but angular code won't be watched.
