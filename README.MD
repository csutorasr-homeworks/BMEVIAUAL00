As the part of this subject we process data for writing to decide if it is written by a left or right-handed person.

The project consists of two parts:
* A processor which decides with different algorithms whether the parts of the writing was right or left-handed
* A web visualizer which helps with the easier visualization in the data

## Example data

Example data can be found in the Data directory. It is added to gitignore so you can add all your data to it.
